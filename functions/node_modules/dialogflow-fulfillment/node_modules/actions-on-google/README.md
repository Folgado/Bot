# Actions on Google Client Library - V2 Alpha release
This is an Alpha release of the Actions on Google client library for Node.js.
The APIs presented are not to be considered stable; we might make breaking changes
to address feedback from the Actions on Google developers community.

This client library makes it easy to create your apps for the Google Assistant, and
supports both Dialogflow fulfillment and the Actions SDK webhook.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/actions-on-google/actions-on-google-nodejs.svg?branch=v2.0.0-alpha)](https://travis-ci.org/actions-on-google/actions-on-google-nodejs)

## Setup Instructions

Install the library with either `npm i actions-on-google@2.0.0-alpha.1` or `yarn add actions-on-google@2.0.0-alpha.1` if you use yarn.

### Dialogflow
 1. Import the appropriate service:

```javascript
const { dialogflow } = require('actions-on-google')
```

 2. Create an instance:

```javascript
const app = dialogflow()
```

### Actions SDK
 1. Import the appropriate service:

```javascript
const { actionssdk } = require('actions-on-google')
```

 2. Create an app instance:

```javascript
const app = actionssdk()
```

You can find more usage samples in the `samples` directory, both for Javascript and Typescript.

## Alpha Instructions
This library uses `yarn` to run commands. Install yarn using instructions from https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install or with npm: `npm i -g yarn`.

Install the library dependencies with `yarn`. If you want to run any of the sample apps, follow the instructions in the sample README.

Public interfaces, classes, functions, objects, and properties are labeled with the JSDoc `@public` tag and exported at the top level. During the alpha, anything can be changed so make sure to strictly reference the version rather than use approximations (don't use `^`, `~`, `>=`, or `*` in the `package.json` version). After alpha during general availability, everything else that is not labeled `@public` and exported at the top level is considered internal and may be changed.

This library supports the following Services:
* Dialogflow v1 and v2
* Actions SDK **v2 only**

### Actions SDK
This library supports only Actions SDK fulfillment version 2.

To ensure that your fulfillment uses version 2, set the [`"fulfillmentApiVersion": 2`](https://github.com/actions-on-google/actionssdk-eliza-nodejs/blob/a44a1b0ef0026ce2b0e525ce38bebbf8540ce344/eliza.json#L41) property in your action package.

### Supported Features
The alpha currently covers most features that exist in v1 with some notable exceptions:
* Transactions support is currently not implemented for the alpha.
* New features released in `1.9.0` and `1.10.0` are not yet implemented but will be soon which includes:
  * Place helper intent known as `askForPlace` in v1.
  * Android Deep Link helper intent known as `askToDeepLink` in v1.
  * Media Controls RichResponse
